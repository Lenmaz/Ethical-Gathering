# Ethical harvest

Based on the Harvest environment from: 
*Leibo, J. Z., Zambaldi, V., Lanctot, M., Marecki, J., & Graepel, T. (2017). Multi-agent reinforcement learning in sequential social dilemmas. In Proceedings of the 16th Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems (pp. 464-473).*

# Installation

Run the Example.py in Python3 to get familiar with the environment. To run it, it is required that you install the following packages:


-	Gym
-	Pycolab
-	Matplotlib
-	Numpy
-	Scipy

And finally you also need to install the CommonsGame gym environment here provided. To do so, go to the main folder (the one containing the file "setup.py") in your terminal and write "pip install -e ."     

Do not forget the dot (.) at the end! Afterwards, a CommonsGame.egg-info folder should have appeared. Try now running example.py


For an in-depth explanation about the environment and how to configure it, please read "Ethical Harvest.pdf".
